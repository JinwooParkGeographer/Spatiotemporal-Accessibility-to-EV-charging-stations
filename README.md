# Spatiotemporal Accessibility to EV charging stations
 Leveraging temporal changes of spatial accessibility measurements for better policy implications

This dataset and code are presented to explain a manuscript entitled **"Leveraging temporal changes of spatial accessibility measurements for better policy implications: a case study of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in Seoul, South Korea"**, which is accepted in International Journal of Geographical Information Science. 

To run this code properly, all shapefile(*.shp) should be stored in a relative path folder (./data).
